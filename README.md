# persistent-homology
Multiparameter persistent homology computations in Macaulay2 (free resolutions of multiparameter persistent modules) to accompany the paper [Multiparameter Persistent Homology-Generic Structures and Quantum Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11433).

Note: Use inverse mutual information of random graph states with controlled random unitary matrices as entangling gates to compute persistent homology as in [Persistent homology of quantum entanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10214). The cade for preparing such graph states is complete in Cirq and Qiskit. The code for computing inverse von Neumann mutual information is still in the works.
